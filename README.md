CUSTOMER CHURN MODEL

Introduction:
    Churning, in the context of business, refers to customers discontinuing their relationship with a company's products or services. Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to proactively address issues, retain customers, and maintain a healthy customer base. This project focuses on analyzing real data obtained from an established commercial bank in Vietnam to predict and understand customer churn patterns.

Data sources:
    The project utilizes real data from a commercial bank in Vietnam, providing an authentic basis for analysis. This data includes customer interactions, transaction history, and other relevant information.

Objectives:
1.  Develop a customer churning model: Create a predictive model to assess the probability that a customer might churn from the company's products.
2.  Develop real-time actionable recommendations: Build tools that offer immediate and practical suggestions for stakeholders to mitigate churn and enhance customer retention.

Processes:
1.  Data Transformation: Prepare and manipulate the data for analysis, ensuring it is suitable for building a predictive model.
2.  Modeling: Develop a robust customer churn prediction model using machine learning algorithms.
3.  Model Validation and Selection: Evaluate the performance of different models and select the one that best suits the project's objectives.
4.  Prediction: Implement the chosen model to predict customer churn and provide actionable insights.

Deliverables:
1.  Scripts in Python:
        Data ETL Processes: Python scripts detailing the data extraction, transformation, and loading processes. Targeted audience: Data analysts/scientists.
2.  Presentation in PowerPoint:
        Introduction: An overview of the project, its significance, and key objectives.
        Key Results: Communicate the findings of the customer churn analysis, highlighting patterns and trends.
        Actionable Recommendations: Provide concrete suggestions for stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of utilizing the predictive models.
        Targeted audience: Managers, salespeople.
3.  Dashboards using [Dashboard Tool]:
    Overall Churning Trend: A dashboard illustrating the general trend of customer churn over time.
    Predictive Probability Dashboard: A tool displaying the predicted probability that a specific customer is likely to churn.
    Targeted audience: Managers, salespeople.

By combining data analysis, machine learning, and effective communication, this project aims to empower stakeholders with the insights needed to address customer churn and improve overall business sustainability.
